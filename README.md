# Time-of-Flight Tracer

This code calculates the time of flight for light to travel to the camera. This is useful when debugging and testing time of flight cameras that are used to capture 3-dimensional scene information.

This particular code is a modified version of the standard [Phyiscally Based Ray Tracer (pbrt)](http://pbrt.org/) program and includes changes to calculate time of flight, in addition to luminance. We are grateful to the original authors' efforts, and the fact that they published their code for all to see and use.

Documentation for the modified project can be found in the [Time-of-Flight Raytracer Documentation](docs/Time-of-Flight%20Raytracer%20Documentation.pdf) file.
